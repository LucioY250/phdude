---

Coding agents are already good at the individual tasks of research: find a paper, summarize
it, draft a section, run a regression. What they are bad at is the *project*. They forget what
you decided last month, they state a shaky claim as fact because it reads well, and they have
no idea that the sample size in your thesis draft disagrees with the one in your defense slides.

PhDude is the part that remembers. It is a free, open-source harness that wraps Claude Code,
Codex or any agent that reads `AGENTS.md` in a persistent, evidence-aware research workspace,
so the agent behaves like a senior colleague who has actually read your project:

- **it knows what you are trying to establish**, what evidence exists, and what is missing;
- **it will not let a claim outrun its evidence**: every claim carries an explicit knowledge
  state, and nothing becomes "canonical" without a decision you approved;
- **it notices contradictions** between your own documents before a reviewer does;
- **it always has an answer to "what should we do next?"**, with the reasons attached.

It makes no assumptions about your field. A clinical trial, an archival history and an
empirical software-engineering paper get the same treatment; discipline-specific vocabulary
and review questions arrive as packs.

> **Where things stand.** This is v0.1. The deterministic core is done and tested: workspace,
> ingestion, the knowledge graph, decisions, conflict detection, packs, `status` and `next`,
> and the Claude Code and Codex adapters. Literature search, analysis execution and the
> writing engine come next; see the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## How it works

The agent thinks. The harness remembers, validates, and refuses.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/diagrams/loop.svg" alt="You talk to the agent, the agent runs the phdude CLI, the CLI validates and logs every write into the research workspace" width="900"></p>

The agent never edits research state by hand. It goes through the CLI, so every change is
schema-validated, attributed to a researcher and an agent, and appended to an audit log. Four
kinds of parts make this up:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/diagrams/layers.svg" alt="Four layers: adapters, skills, packs and core" width="900"></p>

### Where the knowledge comes from

Drop documents in `sources/` and run `phdude ingest`. Nothing here involves a model: it is
hashing, parsing and bookkeeping, and it is idempotent.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/diagrams/ingest.svg" alt="Ingestion pipeline: discover, inventory, dedup, extract, cache, link versions, record" width="900"></p>

The agent then reads the cached text section by section, never whole documents, and turns it
into research objects through `phdude add`: sources, facts with their locators, evidence, and
candidate claims. Everything it adds points back to where it came from:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/diagrams/lineage.svg" alt="Lineage from an artifact through source, evidence and claim to a research question" width="900"></p>

`phdude knowledge trace CLAIM-…` walks this graph in both directions, so "where did this number
come from?" has an answer.

### How a claim earns the right to be stated plainly

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/diagrams/states.svg" alt="Knowledge states: candidate, supported, canonical, disputed, rejected" width="900"></p>

The transition into `canonical` is the only one the CLI gates, and it gates it hard: without an
approved decision that lists the object, `phdude promote` exits with code 3. An agent cannot
talk its way around it, and neither can a tired researcher at 2 a.m.

### How "what next?" is decided

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/diagrams/next.svg" alt="How the next action is chosen: snapshot, ten rules, ranking, top action with reasons" width="900"></p>

Every rule is deterministic and every recommendation carries its reasons, its impact, and the
command that does it. There is no hidden score.

## Install

v0.1 is not on npm yet. Install it from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/LucioY250/phdude && cd phdude
npm ci
npm link
phdude --version      # phdude 0.1.0
```

Node 22 or newer. `pdftotext` (poppler-utils) is optional: without it PDFs are still
inventoried and hashed, and `phdude doctor` tells you exactly what is missing.

```
sudo apt install poppler-utils     # Debian / Ubuntu
brew install poppler               # macOS
```

## Set up your agent

`phdude init` creates the workspace and writes the files each agent host needs. The research
state is identical whichever agent you use, and two people on two different agents can share
one repository.

### Claude Code

```
mkdir my-research && cd my-research
phdude init --title "Adaptive scheduling in edge clusters" --agents claude-code
```

This writes:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Entry point. Imports `AGENTS.md` and adds Claude-specific notes. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating rules, the command reference, and an *index* of skills. Skills are loaded on demand, not up front, to keep your context small. |
| `.claude/commands/phdude*.md` | Slash commands: `/phdude`, `/phdude-bootstrap`, `/phdude-status`, `/phdude-next`, `/phdude-knowledge`, `/phdude-add`, `/phdude-link`, `/phdude-decide`, `/phdude-packs`, `/phdude-mode`, `/phdude-doctor`, `/phdude-ingest`. |
| `.phdude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | The skills themselves, in the open `SKILL.md` convention. |

Open Claude Code in the directory and start with:

```
/phdude bootstrap
```

`/phdude` on its own reports status and the top next action. `/phdude ruthless` (or `lite`,
`full`, `off`) sets how hard the agent pushes back. Every slash command runs the CLI with
`--json` and follows the matching skill; the commands are allow-listed to `phdude` only.

### Codex

```
mkdir my-research && cd my-research
phdude init --title "Adaptive scheduling in edge clusters" --agents codex
```

Codex has no slash commands and no on-demand skill loading, so it gets one file:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating rules, the command reference, and every skill inlined in full. Codex reads it at the start of each session. |

Open Codex in the directory and ask it to bootstrap the research workspace. It will run
`phdude bootstrap --json`, follow the bootstrap skill, and report what the project is, what is
known, what conflicts, and what to do next. From then on ask it for status, the next action, or
any `phdude` command by name.

### Both, or another agent

```
phdude init --title "…" --agents claude-code,codex
```

is the default, and gives you both sets of files; the compact skills index wins for `AGENTS.md`, since Claude Code
loads skills on demand and Codex still finds them by path. Any other agent that reads
`AGENTS.md` (OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and most others) works the same way as Codex. If yours reads
nothing by default, point it at `.phdude/skills/phdude-core/SKILL.md` and it has the rules.

`init` never overwrites a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` you wrote yourself; it only manages files
that carry its own marker, and it tells you which ones it skipped.

## A first session

```
cp ~/Downloads/*.pdf ~/Downloads/*.docx sources/
```

Then `/phdude bootstrap` (Claude Code) or `phdude bootstrap` (Codex, or you). PhDude
inventories and hashes every file, extracts and caches the text, and hands the agent a plan:
classify the artifacts, pull out sources, facts and candidate claims, propose research
questions for you to confirm. From then on you talk to your project:

```
phdude status     # what the project is, what is known, what conflicts
phdude next       # the highest-impact next action, and why
```

`phdude next` never just tells you what to do. It shows its work:

```
Highest-impact next action:

Resolve the conflicting value(s) for "sample_size"

Why:
- sample_size: 312 participants (ART-35146e2f6d, ART-0772a215de) vs 300 participants (ART-f7ced78004)
- 1 claim(s) depend on the conflicting artifacts

Expected impact:
HIGH

Command:
phdude decide propose --title "Resolve sample_size" --rationale "…" --affects FACT-2bc4462edb FACT-54af7fa906 FACT-f62e1a2f34 --change '{"fact_key":"sample_size","canonical_value":…}'

Other candidates:
1. (medium) Classify artifacts with unknown role
2. (medium) Approve or reject pending decisions
3. (low) No further automatic recommendations; add new sources or refine claims
```

That block is the real output of `phdude next` on the [example workspace](examples/generic-thesis)
that ships with the repository. The workspace was generated by a script from the same CLI you
will use; nothing in it is hand-written.

When the agent proposes a decision, you approve it by name, and only then can the object it
names become canonical:

```
phdude decide approve DEC-… --by lucio
phdude promote CLAIM-… --decision DEC-…
```

Three runtime dependencies (`yaml`, `ajv`, `fflate`). No network calls anywhere. The domain
layer cannot import the filesystem, and a test makes sure it never does.

One object per file, content-derived ids, schema on every file. Plain YAML and Markdown under
git: you can read, diff, review and merge all of it without PhDude installed, and if you stop
using it you keep a folder, not a database dump. Details in [docs/workspace.md](docs/workspace.md).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `phdude init [dir]` | Create a workspace. Safe to run again. |
| `phdude bootstrap` | Ingest, detect packs, report status and next, hand off to the agent. |
| `phdude ingest [paths…]` | Inventory, hash, extract and cache source documents. |
| `phdude status` | Project, inventory, knowledge counts, conflicts, pending decisions. |
| `phdude next` | The highest-impact next action, with reasons and the exact command. |
| `phdude knowledge list\|show\|trace` | Query the knowledge graph and follow its lineage. |
| `phdude add <type>` | Add a claim, evidence, fact, source, question, hypothesis, method or result; set an artifact's role with `add artifact-role`. |
| `phdude link <id> --to <ids…>` | Attach evidence to a claim, a claim or method to a question, an artifact to a source. |
| `phdude decide propose\|approve\|reject\|supersede` | Research decisions. The agent proposes; the researcher decides. |
| `phdude promote <id> --decision <DEC-id>` | Make an object canonical, with an approved decision behind it. |
| `phdude cite list\|check\|export` | Citation registry: list sources, verify them, export BibTeX/CSL-JSON. |
| `phdude packs list\|detect\|apply <name>` | Field and method packs. |
| `phdude mode lite\|full\|ruthless\|off` | How hard the agent pushes back. |
| `phdude migrate [--dry-run]` | Upgrade a workspace written by an older PhDude. |
| `phdude doctor` | Adapters, cache, schema versions, git state. |

Every command takes `--json`. Exit codes mean something: 0 ok, 1 usage, 2 validation,
3 policy, 4 external tool missing. Errors come with a suggested action. The full reference is
in [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md).

## Packs

Seven packs ship with v0.1: four fields (`computer-science`, `business`, `medicine`,
`humanities`) and three methods (`quantitative`, `qualitative`, `systematic-review`). Each
brings terminology, reviewers, recommended checks and a skill with concrete review questions
and the epistemic norms of its discipline, so "demonstrates" and "suggests" are used the way
that field uses them. `phdude packs detect` recommends packs from what it finds in your
sources; nothing is applied until you say so.

Writing your own is a `pack.yaml` and a `SKILL.md`: see [docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md).

## Principles

- **Research quality over text generation.** The goal is publishable research, not fluent prose.
- **Evidence determines language strength.** Nothing is stated more confidently than its
  knowledge state allows.
- **Human authority.** Research questions, methodology, accepted results and canonical claims
  belong to the researcher. The agent proposes; approval is a human act, enforced by the CLI.
- **Field agnosticism.** No discipline is assumed. Domain knowledge arrives as packs.
- **Local-first, and the data is yours.** Your research lives in your repository, in a format
  that outlives this tool. Nothing is sent anywhere.
- **Token-efficient by architecture.** Agents read cached sections, not whole documents, and
  load a skill only when they need it.
- **Skill-first, not skill-only.** Skills define capabilities. Core defines truth.

The reasoning behind the big calls is in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

## Contributing

Install from source as above, then:

```
npm run format && npm run lint && npm test
```

Tests use `node:test` only and run in a few seconds. New parsers, agent hosts and packs plug
in behind documented ports with contract suites you can run against your own implementation.
Start at [docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md); [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) records what
changed and why.
